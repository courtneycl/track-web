Government of Canada departments are required to use the HTTPS protocol, approved encryption algorithms, and approved certificates as outlined in [Implementing HTTPS for Secure Web Connections: Information Technology Policy Implementation Notice (ITPIN)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/policy-implementation-notices/implementing-https-secure-web-connections-itpin.html). These measures ensure the secure transmission of data online and the delivery of secure web services.

Measuring and tracking policy compliance takes effort, time, and domain knowledge. The *Track web security compliance* tool makes that process easier for both the domain owners and policy owners.
